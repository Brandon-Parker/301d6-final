It is not for children. The stories were written complete, and we later determined which words would make the stories the most ridiculous as possible when replaced with random nouns, verbs, or adjectives. We put together a function that would allow the mad-libs to be filled in by the user input that would transfer the input from local storage on the front page to the results page and populate the correct empty array with each word submitted.</p>",

Students can sign up for the help list, indicate what sort of issue theyâ€™re having, give a brief description of their problem, and receive a list of suggestions for where to look while waiting.</p>",
